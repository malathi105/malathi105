<p> INRODUCTION OF DIGITAL TRUST :
 Trust in the use of digital services is one of the key elements in a human-centred digital transition. We want our customers to feel confident about using our products and 
services, and to be aware that we respect their rights at all times, offering them choices about the use of their personal information. In short, we want our customers to be in control of their digital experience.We have therefore defined digital trust based on four pillars that shape our commitment to the customer.

 <li>The privacy strategy is based on three pillars:
 • PROTECTION: Protect our customers’ personal data through robust policies and processes.
 • TRANSPARENCY: Be transparent about how and why we collect, use, store and delete our customers’ personal data. 
• EMPOWERMENT: Empower our customers through simple and secure tools so that they can control the use of their personal data </li>
</p>

<p> Governance:
 Telefónica has an array of processes designed to ensure its commitment to the right to privacy of all persons whose data we have access to. These processes are described in the Governance Model Rule on Personal Data Protection, whose Privacy govern ancelines of action are designed to ensure sufficient means and resources to guarantee that privacy management is in keeping with corporate strategy.</p>

<p> Policy :
We promote and review different global and local policies and processes to strengthen our commitment to the right to privacy of all persons whose data we have access to through the definition and implementation of operational privacy domains throughout the data lifecycle.</p>

<p> Lines of action GRI
 Our lines of action in the area of privacy are configured around the following subjects:
 •Privacy by Design (PbD)
 •Digital privacy
 •Transparency initiatives
 •Client empowerment
 •Consultation and complaint mechanismsion
</p>

<p>
<li>Privacy by Design (PbD):
 Privacy by Design (PbD)The principle of Privacy by Design (PbD) is undoubtedly one of the Telefonica Group’s essential, strategic pillars and is defined in its compulsory internal regulations.The concept of Privacy by Design entails, among other relevant matters, the entire organisation’s duty to establish a data management governance model to ensure consideration not only of the application of privacy protection measures from a legal and security point of view in the early stages of any project, but also all the business procedures and practices related to each processing activity or project involving personal data. We have our own Privacy by Design Guidelines to define the set of rules, standards and legal and security processes that must be taken into account to comply with Privacy by Design obligations. This is in accordance with the legal framework and our Global Privacy Policy, both of which are to ensure that the rights and freedoms of the individuals who hold the personal data are guaranteed as from the initial definition of any processing project or activity.</li>

<li>Digital Privacy Framework:
 At Telefonica, the PbD process is digitised through the Digital Privacy Framework implemented in the systems and platforms where processing takes place, such as the 4th 
platform.The Digital Privacy Framework defines the global legal and privacy strategy framework with respect to GDPR and ePrivacy in data processing platform products and systems.The Digital Privacy Framework adapts privacy guidelines to a technological reality by standardising and conceptualising the functional and technical requirements of the dynamics of privacy systems and applying them automatically and digitally to processing.This digitisation is implemented by design and by default, and naturally enables us to build a transparent ecosystem, making it possible to build a dynamic and automatic privacy process between the customer and the systems that carry out the processing, in compliance with the GDPR. </li>

<li> Client empowerment: 
As part of our principle of transparency, Telefónica provides its customers with access to the data they generate during the use of our products and services – data that are collected in the so-called “Personal Data Space” of 4th platform and which are accessible through different channels such as the Transparency Centre in the Mi Movistar app.
2020 saw the launch of the Transparency Centre in Spain, which offers all customers access to their privacy preferences and the management of data collected in the 
Personal Data Space, which is currently available to a group of users through the “My Movistar” application (in the Security and Privacy section of the User Profile).
 In the Transparency Centre, through the Privacy Permissions section, customers can manage the legitimising grounds relating to the use of their data for certain purposes. The Access and Download section offers useful views of different types of data, with a user-friendly experience and in keeping with privacy criteria. It also has the option to download a document with further details of the datasets. Our intention is to have the Transparency Centre available in all channels by 2021. Our customers will be able to access it from the movistar.es online channel, where both functionalities will be offered, and it will also be accessible from the television for the same groups of customers who currently have these functionalities.The Transparency Centre experience has been designed to be user-centric, avoiding complex legal language and explaining the purpose for which data is processed and the nature of that data within Telefónica, providing clarity, transparency and reinforcing trust</li>
 
Digital security :
 <li>Digital security is a key element of our business. Its ultimate goal is to ensure our resilience, in other words, our ability to withstand and contain attacks so that our business is either not affected at all or, if it is affected, the level is tolerable. This is applied in practices, processes, tools and capabilities that aim to anticipate and prevent cybersecurity risks.
Given the current context of cybersecurity and Telefonica’s status as a digital operator, special focus is placed on the following processes:
 a.Cyber-intelligence and incident managementWe have tools and capabilities for the entire cycle of potential incidents:
 • Anticipation, before it can affect us.
 • Prevention, ensuring the protection of both facilities and assets, as well as customer data and identity.
 • Detection, through twelve Security Operation Centres.
 • Response, through a network of 15 Incident Response 
Centres (CSIRT) working in a coordinated manner at local and global level to resume normal service as soon as possible and with the least possible impact.
 Our approach to cyber-intelligence is based on a proactive approach, applying knowledge and technology to achieve the required levels of protection by quickly detecting breaches or attacks on assets. We also build the technical and human capabilities needed to respond effectively and quickly to any breach or incident in order to minimise attacks and their consequences.</li>
